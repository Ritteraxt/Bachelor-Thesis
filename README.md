The notebooks are not yet in their final form, they work, but still contain "useless" parts of code. 

Flat_Calculation allows to plug in any shape of S(k) = S1(k1)* S2(k2)* S3(K3). 
The notebook with the way too long name allows to pulug in any shape of S(k) = S(k_t). 
Again, the code is currently quite messy and maybe hard to understand. I will fix this up to the 10.07.
